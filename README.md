# Expose - Exposure Therapy - Singleplayer Story Psych Puzzle Game

## Expos√©
The player lives through all the frears and phobias of the game character. All these phobias have an origin - most of them in the first couple of years in the protaginists life. But this is not told obviously to the player. Only sublte and distorted acoustic and visual fragments may give a hint. E.g. Difficult birth is illustrated by extremely distorted audio and by a lightsource shaped like the birth channel from the insight. Both barely recoginzable - they mainly convey a mood than tell the story. The player struggles through the gameworld - barely grasping what is going on.
The levels or puzzles mechanics reffer to the current phobia. This can be extending or shrinking rooms when it comes to claustrophobia or its oposite.

Optional the player can play the whole game again in some kind of fast forward mode and the explaination of the current phobia.
