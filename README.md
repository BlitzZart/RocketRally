# Expose - Exposure Therapy - Singleplayer Psych Walking Simulator Puzzle Story Game

## Exposé
The player lives through all the frears and phobias of the game character. All these phobias have an origin - most of them in the first couple of years in the protaginists life. But this is not told obviously to the player. Only sublte and distorted acoustic and visual fragments may give a hint. E.g. Difficult birth is illustrated by extremely distorted audio and by a lightsource shaped like the birth channel from the insight. Both barely recoginzable - they mainly convey a mood than tell the story. The player struggles through the gameworld - barely grasping what is going on.
The levels or puzzles mechanics reffer to the current phobia. This can be extending or shrinking rooms when it comes to claustrophobia or its oposite.

Optional the player can play the whole game again in some kind of fast forward mode and the explaination of the current phobia.

## Setting
Surreal, dream like, mostly gloomy, endless nightmare.

## Style, Appearence
Simplyfied, non-realistic, dark, outline shader, black with white edges.
Some kind of abstract motionblur could work well to generate dream like effects.

## Mechanics of Fears
Generally it is about exposing yourselfe. This means that one has to fight the fear and don't run away if possible. Usualy that means to do the most counter intuitive possible. When the noise becomes unbearable and the visuals are totally distorted or dark the player is on the right way.

### 01_s01 Start 
Everything is bright. **Movement is disabled**. You hear nothing but your own breath. But that also fades away soon - silece. When the breath stops the environment gets visible. All you see are smooth mountains and hills in the distance. Still bright and minimalistic. **Now movement is enabled**. When you rotate the camera about 180° _(find positoin)_, on a nearly invisible wall you see a dark, nearly black, door. If you try to avoid going into that door by running in an other direction you will fail. Eventually, the door will always appear on the horizon in front of you. As you approach the door everything gets darker and darker and a distant reverbing noise gets louder **Distorted and alienated sounds of surgery (heart monitor and people talking - not recognizable)**. When you step into it, everything goes black and silent for a while. **No way back**. 

### 01_s02 - Birth - Fear of small roomes
Then the sound comes back slowly first only as a abstract slow heartbeat then a second beat, thre times as fast starts and it gets noisy, loud and aggressive but everything remains black. Then soon a tiny white spot appears far away. It slowly comes closer and you can move in it's direction to speed up the process. As the point comes closer it looks more like a vertical line. Then soon it looks like slit/rift. After a certain proximity the  sound becomes smoother, quieter and more calm. The slit shines bright. But then, right when you are about to touch the light, it starts moving away (and/or getting narrower). With distance the noise aggressiveness increases again. You have to run torwards the light. When you get very clos (<2m) the slip hovers above the groudn (1.5m). When you get even closer it sucks you in/pulls over you. And you start falling torwards a dark room in which you land eventualy.


### 02_p01 - Fear of small roomes
You stand up after the fall. The first time you see the geometry of architecture. Still abstract. Dark nearly black surfaces with bright edges reveal the geometry of the room. It's connected to other rooms, halls, and corridors. While roaming around you enter a big room with a couple of windows a balkony (or galleria) at its end. On the balkony you find a crate but you cannot open it. You have to go back. On the way to the door you see a small glowing red stone lying around. You approach it slowly **[Running disabled]** when you touch it **Intaract (force player to look at door?)** the door in front of you immediately disappears. When you go back all windows and the balkony are gone **Running still disabled**. Each time you move the room shrinks a little and movement gets slower **Slow down walking speed**
