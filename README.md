# Expose - Exposure Therapy - Singleplayer Story Psych Puzzle Game

## Exposé
The player lives through all the frears and phobias of the game character. All these phobias have an origin - most of them in the first couple of years in the protaginists life. But this is not told obviously to the player. Only sublte and distorted acoustic and visual fragments may give a hint. E.g. Difficult birth is illustrated by extremely distorted audio and by a lightsource shaped like the birth channel from the insight. Both barely recoginzable - they mainly convey a mood than tell the story. The player struggles through the gameworld - barely grasping what is going on.
The levels or puzzles mechanics reffer to the current phobia. This can be extending or shrinking rooms when it comes to claustrophobia or its oposite.

Optional the player can play the whole game again in some kind of fast forward mode and the explaination of the current phobia.

## Setting
Surreal, dream like, mostly gloomy, endless nightmare.

## Style, Appearence
Simplyfied, non-realistic, dark, outline shader, black with white edges.
Some kind of abstract motionblur could work well to generate dream like effects.

## Mechanics of Fears
Generally it is about exposing yourselfe. This means that one has to fight the fear and don't run away if possible. Usualy that means to do the most counter intuitive possible. When the noise becomes unbearable and the visuals are totally distorted or dark the player is on the right way.

### 01_START - Fear of small roomes 
Everything is bright. {Movement is disabled}. You hear nothing but your own breath. But that also fades away soon - silece. When the breath stops the environment gets visible. Still bright and minimalistic. {Movement is enabled}. When you rotate the camera 90° to the right, on a nearly invisible wall you see a dark, nearly black, door. As you approach the door everything gets darker and darker. When you step into it, the environment is as dark as the door was from the beginning. {No way back}.
